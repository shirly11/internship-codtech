DESCRIPTION:

During the course of my Python internship at CODTECH, I had the opportunity to work on four practical and impactful tasks that strengthened my understanding of real-world applications of Python. The internship emphasized hands-on problem-solving through task-based learning, covering key areas such as API integration, data visualization, PDF automation, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning. Each task helped me explore specific libraries and development tools that are widely used in the industry today.

One of the primary tools I worked with was the **`requests`** library in Python, which allowed me to perform **API integration** by fetching real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. I then used **`matplotlib`** and **`seaborn`** to visualize the data, particularly temperature trends over time. This task taught me how to handle JSON responses, extract relevant fields, and convert raw data into meaningful graphical representations. It gave me a solid understanding of RESTful APIs and the importance of data-driven dashboards in software applications.

The second task focused on **automated report generation**, where I used **`pandas`** for data analysis and **`FPDF`** for creating PDF reports. This allowed me to read structured data from CSV files, format them, and convert tabular information into a clean and readable report. I learned how to define headers, manage layouts, and dynamically add data into PDF format, simulating real-world reporting tasks in business and enterprise software. This task enhanced my understanding of how to automate documentation, which is critical in data reporting and record-keeping.

The third project involved building a basic **chatbot using NLP**. I explored **`nltk` (Natural Language Toolkit)** to tokenize input, match keywords, and generate human-like responses based on user queries. Additionally, I explored regular expressions and pattern matching using rule-based techniques. This helped me understand how natural language understanding (NLU) works at a fundamental level and how chatbots can assist in customer support, query resolution, and smart assistants.

The fourth task involved building a **machine learning model** using **`scikit-learn`**. I worked on a spam email classifier using the **Naive Bayes algorithm**. I used tools like **`CountVectorizer`** for feature extraction, **`train_test_split`** for data partitioning, and **`MultinomialNB`** for classification. I also evaluated model accuracy using **`accuracy_score`**, which gave me insights into performance metrics. I learned the complete ML pipeline — from data preprocessing to training and evaluation — which has immense value in predictive modeling and AI-driven applications.

Apart from the main tasks, I also developed a **console-based contact book** using core Python. This involved implementing Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations using dictionaries and loops, which improved my logic-building skills and understanding of control flow. I later extended my knowledge by creating a **simple calculator**, further reinforcing the concepts of input validation, arithmetic logic, and modular programming.

Through this internship, I have become comfortable using tools like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `nltk`, `scikit-learn`, `fpdf`, and the standard Python libraries. I gained valuable experience in integrating third-party APIs, working with structured data, developing AI-powered scripts, and understanding the basics of machine learning. This hands-on exposure has deepened my confidence in Python programming and strengthened my foundation to work on more advanced projects in the future. Overall, this internship was a crucial step toward my journey as a Python developer.
